# Sadaqah Box

## Project Idea
Our web app, named "SadaqahBox", aims to tackle two significant issues during the holy month of Ramadan: food waste and hunger. The project will provide a platform for people to donate food to those in need, reducing food waste and ensuring that everyone has access to nutritious meals during Ramadan.


## How will the web app be useful?
The web app will be useful in multiple ways:

1. It will provide an easy and convenient way for people to donate food during Ramadan.

2. It will help reduce food waste by redirecting surplus food to those in need.

3. It will enable people to give back to their communities during a time of great significance for Muslims.

4. It will help provide nutritious meals to those who may not have access to them otherwise.


## Functionality Plan
The key features of the "SadaqahBox" web app will include:

1. A page that allows users to manage their donations and view their donation history.

2. A donation form that enables users to provide details about their food donations, including quantity, type of food, and pickup/drop-off locations.

3. A search feature that allows users to search for food donations by location and type of food.

4. An email notification system that sends notifications to users when their donations are received and when there are new donations available in their area.
